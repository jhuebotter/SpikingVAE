## Results

Tests are done on Ubuntu 18.04 with 16 GB RAM, Ryzen 5 3600, nVidia RTX 2070.

## Usage

### Setup

>Requires Python 3.7

The following lines will clone the repository and install all the required dependencies.

```bash
$ https://github.com/jhuebotter/SpikingVAE.git
$ cd SpikingVAE
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This project uses Weights and Biases for logging. In order to use this package, having an account with their platform is mandatory. Before running the scrips, you to login from you local machine by running

```bash
$ wandb login
```

For more information please see the [official documentation](https://docs.wandb.com/quickstart).


### Datasets

In order to download datasets used in the paper experiments use
```bash
$ python setup.py
```

with options `mnist` and `fashion`. For example, if case you want to replicate *all* experiments in this thesis, you must run the following line:

```bash
$ python setup.py mnist fashion
```

It will download and store the datasets locally in the **data** folder. 

### Pretrained Models


### Train Models 

```bash
$ cd src
$ python [model] [args] 
```

For example

```bash
$ python train_cnn.py --dataset mnist --epochs 10 --report-interval 1 --lr 0.001 
```

To visualize training results in TensorBoard, we can use the following command from a new terminal within **src** folder. 

```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir='results/logs'
```
